If crime involving the ownership of land by non-citizens which, had in at one point, been forcefully taken by non-indigenous, the land should be given to the indigenous of the land.
Rationale: The wrong thing happened in the past but we've since formed a country with laws and established a working relationship with our lands indigenous with laws intentioned to be moral, just, and accountable.  If this firmly established governing body has failed to protect the land which was once forcefully taken from the indegenous, it should be returned to the indigenous... unless they were the ones who wilfully sold the land.  If the indigenous initiated the sale of the land, the land ownership should fall to the local, state, or federal government.  The idea is to continually return forcefully taken land back to the indigenous, thereby giving he opportunity for new civil agreements based on a reevaluation of the civilities promised between immigrated residents and indigenous peoples.
