If crime involving the ownership of land by non-citizens which, had in at one point, been forcefully taken by non-indigenous, the land should be given to the indigenous of the land.
Rationale: The wrong thing happened in the past but we've since formed a country with laws and established a working relationship with our lands indigenous with laws intentioned to be moral, just, and accountable.  If this firmly established governing body has failed to protect the land which was once forcefully taken from the indegenous, it should be returned to the indigenous... unless they were the ones who wilfully sold the land.  If the indigenous initiated the sale of the land, the land ownership should fall to the local, state, or federal government.  The idea is to continually return forcefully taken land back to the indigenous, thereby giving he opportunity for new civil agreements with reevaluation of the civilities promised between immigrated residents and indigenous peoples.


What classifies an organization as a news organization and affords the protection of "freedom of the press."
Their news must be immutable and retrievable.  Specifically, they need to print on paper and in wide circulation.  Citizens must be able to see retractions and revisions and hold news organizations accountable for their stories.


clickbait:  Freelance news sites are not news.  Stories that simply site previous articles on the same site, by the same author, or other news sites' stories are not publishing news. They are regurgitating.

Journalists need to stop using "here" "they" "these" in headlines.  Pure clickbait articles. "Here are the reasons why..." They're totally clickbaiting you to open the story.  The headline needs to summarize the story- not lead.
